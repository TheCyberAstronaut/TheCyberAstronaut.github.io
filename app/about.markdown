My name is Matthew Hancock (aka TheCyberAstronaut), I am a Cyber Security student at The University of Tulsa, focused on developing skills in offensive and defensive security. 

When I am not in class I work Part-Time as a Security Analyst in TU's Security Operations Center where I triage alerts, maintain tools, hunt threats, and enhance our SIEM by integrating log sources and building detection rules.

I am also in charge of the infrastructure for Root66Tulsa Cyber Clubs where I help maintain resources for events, labs, tools, and ranges for our competition teams.
